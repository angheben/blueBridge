HTML notes

name="viewport": This attribute specifies the purpose of the <meta> tag, which is to define viewport settings.

content="width=width-device, initial-scale=1.0": This attribute specifies the content of the viewport settings.
It consists of two directives separated by a comma:

width=device-width: This directive sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
This ensures that the webpage's content adapts properly to different screen sizes and devices.

initial-scale=1.0: This directive sets the initial zoom level when the webpage is first loaded.
A value of 1.0 indicates that the webpage should be displayed at its initial size without any zooming applied.
